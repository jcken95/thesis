MASTER REFERENCES DOCUMENT
THIS HAS **ALL** MY REFERENCES IN

This is an example of a BibTeX references file.  Any reference you'll ever need
can go in this one file.  In your thesis/paper you just need to say

\bibliography{references}	%References
\bibliographystyle{style_file}	%BibTeX (.bst) style file

which will automatically include any references you mention in your thesis.
Any references you don't make are not included.  If you want to include a
reference you don't mention just use

\nocite{label}

which will insert the reference 'label' into your bibliography.  I like the
style file (jfm.bst) provided by the Journal of Fluid Mechanics.  You can
download it from their website (http://jfm-www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/).

    abstract = "{Renewable energy projects, such as large offshore wind farms, are critical to achieving low-emission targets set by governments. Stochastic computer models allow us to explore future scenarios to aid decision making while considering the most relevant uncertainties. Complex stochastic computer models can be prohibitively slow, and thus an emulator may be constructed and deployed to allow for efficient computation. We present a novel heteroscedastic Gaussian Process emulator that exploits cheap approximations to a stochastic offshore wind farm simulator. We also conduct a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to understand the influence of key parameters in the wind farm model, which will help us to plan a probability elicitation in the future.}",

  abstract = 	 {We introduce a new structured kernel interpolation (SKI) framework, which generalises and unifies inducing point methods for scalable Gaussian processes (GPs). SKI methods produce kernel approximations for fast computations through kernel interpolation. The SKI framework clarifies how the quality of an inducing point approach depends on the number of inducing (aka interpolation) points, interpolation strategy, and GP covariance kernel. SKI also provides a mechanism to create new scalable kernel methods, through choosing different kernel interpolation strategies. Using SKI, with local cubic kernel interpolation, we introduce KISS-GP, which is 1) more scalable than inducing point alternatives, 2) naturally enables Kronecker and Toeplitz algebra for substantial additional gains in scalability, without requiring any grid data, and 3) can be used for fast and expressive kernel learning. KISS-GP costs O(n) time and storage for GP inference. We evaluate KISS-GP for kernel matrix approximation, kernel learning, and natural sound modelling.}

  abstract = 	 {Many problems in machine learning and statistics involve nested expectations and thus do not permit conventional Monte Carlo (MC) estimation. For such problems, one must nest estimators, such that terms in an outer estimator themselves involve calculation of a separate, nested, estimation. We investigate the statistical implications of nesting MC estimators, including cases of multiple levels of nesting, and establish the conditions under which they converge. We derive corresponding rates of convergence and provide empirical evidence that these rates are observed in practice. We further establish a number of pitfalls that can arise from naive nesting of MC estimators, provide guidelines about how these can be avoided, and lay out novel methods for reformulating certain classes of nested expectation problems into single expectations, leading to improved convergence rates. We demonstrate the applicability of our work by using our results to develop a new estimator for discrete Bayesian experimental design problems and derive error bounds for a class of variational objectives.}

    abstract = { A standard objective in computer experiments is to approximate the behavior of an unknown function on a compact domain from a few evaluations inside the domain. When little is known about the function, space-filling design is advisable: typically, points of evaluation spread out across the available space are obtained by minimizing a geometrical (for instance, covering radius) or a discrepancy criterion measuring distance to uniformity. The paper investigates connections between design for integration (quadrature design), construction of the (continuous) best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) for the location model, space-filling design, and minimization of energy (kernel discrepancy) for signed measures. Integrally strictly positive definite kernels define strictly convex energy functionals, with an equivalence between the notions of potential and directional derivative, showing the strong relation between discrepancy minimization and more traditional design of optimal experiments. In particular, kernel herding algorithms, which are special instances of vertex-direction methods used in optimal design, can be applied to the construction of point sequences with suitable space-filling properties. }

abstract = {Optimization is an inherent human tendency that gained new life after the advent of calculus; now, as the world grows increasingly reliant on complex systems, optimization has become both more important and more challenging than ever before. Engineering Optimization provides a practically-focused introduction to modern engineering optimization best practices, covering fundamental analytical and numerical techniques throughout each stage of the optimization process. Although essential algorithms are explained in detail, the focus lies more in the human function: how to create an appropriate objective function, choose decision variables, identify and incorporate constraints, define convergence, and other critical issues that define the success or failure of an optimization project. Examples, exercises, and homework throughout reinforce the author’s “do, not study” approach to learning, underscoring the application-oriented discussion that provides a deep, generic understanding of the optimization process that can be applied to any field. Providing excellent reference for students or professionals, Engineering Optimization: Describes and develops a variety of algorithms, including gradient based (such as Newton’s, and Levenberg-Marquardt), direct search (such as Hooke-Jeeves, Leapfrogging, and Particle Swarm), along with surrogate functions for surface characterization Provides guidance on optimizer choice by application, and explains how to determine appropriate optimizer parameter values Details current best practices for critical stages of specifying an optimization procedure, including decision variables, defining constraints, and relationship modeling Provides access to software and Visual Basic macros for Excel on the companion website, along with solutions to examples presented in the book Clear explanations, explicit equation derivations, and practical examples make this book ideal for use as part of a class or self-study, assuming a basic understanding of statistics, calculus, computer programming, and engineering models. Anyone seeking best practices for “making the best choices” will find value in this introductory resource.},

abstract="In this paper, we propose novel methods of quantifying expert opinion about prior distributions for multinomial models. Two different multivariate priors are elicited using median and quartile assessments of the multinomial probabilities. First, we start by eliciting a univariate beta distribution for the probability of each category. Then we elicit the hyperparameters of the Dirichlet distribution, as a tractable conjugate prior, from those of the univariate betas through various forms of reconciliation using least-squares techniques. However, a multivariate copula function will give a more flexible correlation structure between multinomial parameters if it is used as their multivariate prior distribution. So, second, we use beta marginal distributions to construct a Gaussian copula as a multivariate normal distribution function that binds these marginals and expresses the dependence structure between them. The proposed method elicits a positive-definite correlation matrix of this Gaussian copula. The two proposed methods are designed to be used through interactive graphical software written in Java.",

abstract = {<p>Scoring rules assess the quality of probabilistic forecasts, by assigning a numerical score based on the predictive distribution and on the event or value that materializes. A scoring rule is proper if the forecaster maximizes the expected score for an observation drawn from the distributionF if he or she issues the probabilistic forecast F, rather than G ≠ F. It is strictly proper if the maximum is unique. In prediction problems, proper scoring rules encourage the forecaster to make careful assessments and to be honest. In estimation problems, strictly proper scoring rules provide attractive loss and utility functions that can be tailored to the problem at hand. This article reviews and develops the theory of proper scoring rules on general probability spaces, and proposes and discusses examples thereof. Proper scoring rules derive from convex functions and relate to information measures, entropy functions, and Bregman divergences. In the case of categorical variables, we prove a rigorous version of the Savage representation. Examples of scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts in the form of predictive densities include the logarithmic, spherical, pseudospherical, and quadratic scores. The continuous ranked probability score applies to probabilistic forecasts that take the form of predictive cumulative distribution functions. It generalizes the absolute error and forms a special case of a new and very general type of score, the energy score. Like many other scoring rules, the energy score admits a kernel representation in terms of negative definite functions, with links to inequalities of Hoeffding type, in both univariate and multivariate settings. Proper scoring rules for quantile and interval forecasts are also discussed. We relate proper scoring rules to Bayes factors and to cross-validation, and propose a novel form of cross-validation known as random-fold cross-validation. A case study on probabilistic weather forecasts in the North American Pacific Northwest illustrates the importance of propriety. We note optimum score approaches to point and quantile estimation, and propose the intuitively appealing interval score as a utility function in interval estimation that addresses width as well as coverage.</p>},

abstract = {Summary.  In many areas of science and technology, mathematical models are built to simulate complex real world phenomena. Such models are typically implemented in large computer programs and are also very complex, such that the way that the model responds to changes in its inputs is not transparent. Sensitivity analysis is concerned with understanding how changes in the model inputs influence the outputs. This may be motivated simply by a wish to understand the implications of a complex model but often arises because there is uncertainty about the true values of the inputs that should be used for a particular application. A broad range of measures have been advocated in the literature to quantify and describe the sensitivity of a model's output to variation in its inputs. In practice the most commonly used measures are those that are based on formulating uncertainty in the model inputs by a joint probability distribution and then analysing the induced uncertainty in outputs, an approach which is known as probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We present a Bayesian framework which unifies the various tools of prob- abilistic sensitivity analysis. The Bayesian approach is computationally highly efficient. It allows effective sensitivity analysis to be achieved by using far smaller numbers of model runs than standard Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, all measures of interest may be computed from a single set of runs.},

abstract = {Natural language processing (NLP) went through a profound transformation in the mid-1980s when it shifted to make heavy use of corpora and data-driven techniques to analyze language. Since then, the use of statistical techniques in NLP has evolved in several ways. One such example of evolution took place in the late 1990s or early 2000s, when full-fledged Bayesian machinery was introduced to NLP. This Bayesian approach to NLP has come to accommodate for various shortcomings in the frequentist approach and to enrich it, especially in the unsupervised setting, where statistical learning is done without target prediction examples. We cover the methods and algorithms that are needed to fluently read Bayesian learning papers in NLP and to do research in the area. These methods and algorithms are partially borrowed from both machine learning and statistics and are partially developed "in-house" in NLP. We cover inference techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and variational inference, Bayesian estimation, and nonparametric modeling. We also cover fundamental concepts in Bayesian statistics such as prior distributions, conjugacy, and generative modeling. Finally, we cover some of the fundamental modeling techniques in NLP, such as grammar modeling and their use with Bayesian analysis.},

        abstract = {Elicitation is a key task for subjectivist Bayesians. Although skeptics hold that elicitation cannot (or perhaps should not) be done, in practice it brings statisticians closer to their clients and subject-matter expert colleagues. This article reviews the state of the art, reflecting the experience of statisticians informed by the fruits of a long line of psychological research into how people represent uncertain information cognitively and how they respond to questions about that information. In a discussion of the elicitation process, the first issue to address is what it means for an elicitation to be successful; that is, what criteria should be used. Our answer is that a successful elicitation faithfully represents the opinion of the person being elicited. It is not necessarily "true" in some objectivistic sense, and cannot be judged in that way. We see that elicitation as simply part of the process of statistical modeling. Indeed, in a hierarchical model at which point the likelihood ends and the prior begins is ambiguous. Thus the same kinds of judgment that inform statistical modeling in general also inform elicitation of prior distributions. The psychological literature suggests that people are prone to certain heuristics and biases in how they respond to situations involving uncertainty. As a result, some of the ways of asking questions about uncertain quantities are preferable to others, and appear to be more reliable. However, data are lacking on exactly how well the various methods work, because it is unclear, other than by asking using an elicitation method, just what the person believes. Consequently, one is reduced to indirect means of assessing elicitation methods. The tool chest of methods is growing. Historically, the first methods involved choosing hyperparameters using conjugate prior families, at a time when these were the only families for which posterior distributions could be computed. Modern computational methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, have freed elicitation from this constraint. As a result, now both parametric and nonparametric methods are available for low-dimensional problems. High-dimensional problems are probably best thought of as lacking another hierarchical level, which has the effect of reducing the as-yet-unelicited parameter space. Special considerations apply to the elicitation of group opinions. Informal methods, such as Delphi, encourage the participants to discuss the issue in the hope of reaching consensus. Formal methods, such as weighted averages or logarithmic opinion pools, each have mathematical characteristics that are uncomfortable. Finally, there is the question of what a group opinion even means, because it is not necessarily the opinion of any participant.}

Elicitation is important in situations, such as modelling the safety of nuclear installations or assessing the risk of terrorist attacks, where expert knowledge is essentially the only source of good information. It also plays a major role in other contexts by augmenting scarce observational data, through the use of Bayesian statistical methods. However, elicitation is not a simple task, and practitioners need to be aware of a wide range of research findings in order to elicit expert judgements accurately and reliably. Uncertain Judgements introduces the area, before guiding the reader through the study of appropriate elicitation methods, illustrated by a variety of multi-disciplinary examples.}

    abstract = {Advances in scientific computing have allowed the development of complex models that are being routinely applied to problems in disease epidemiology, public health and decision making. The utility of these models depends in part on how well they can reproduce empirical data. However, fitting such models to real world data is greatly hindered both by large numbers of input and output parameters, and by long run times, such that many modelling studies lack a formal calibration methodology. We present a novel method that has the potential to improve the calibration of complex infectious disease models (hereafter called simulators). We present this in the form of a tutorial and a case study where we history match a dynamic, event-driven, individual-based stochastic HIV simulator, using extensive demographic, behavioural and epidemiological data available from Uganda. The tutorial describes history matching and emulation. History matching is an iterative procedure that reduces the simulator's input space by identifying and discarding areas that are unlikely to provide a good match to the empirical data. History matching relies on the computational efficiency of a Bayesian representation of the simulator, known as an emulator. Emulators mimic the simulator's behaviour, but are often several orders of magnitude faster to evaluate. In the case study, we use a 22 input simulator, fitting its 18 outputs simultaneously. After 9 iterations of history matching, a non-implausible region of the simulator input space was identified that was  times smaller than the original input space. Simulator evaluations made within this region were found to have a 65% probability of fitting all 18 outputs. History matching and emulation are useful additions to the toolbox of infectious disease modellers. Further research is required to explicitly address the stochastic nature of the simulator as well as to account for correlations between outputs.},

        abstract = {The UK offshore wind sector has developed rapidly, but needs to develop even further to meet the low carbon targets set by the government. In order to increase capacity and reduce costs, new offshore wind farms will use larger and more complex technology that goes beyond current understanding and experience. As a result, predicting the technical performance of offshore wind farms involves a considerable amount of uncertainty, especially during early life when teething problems may arise. We present a model that allows us to distinguish between natural variability and state-of-knowledge uncertainty when assessing the growth in technical performance of offshore wind farms over early operational life. As such, the model can be used to inform decisions to reduce uncertainties and to support effective risk management. To describe wind farm performance, we use an indicator we call availability-informed capability measures the capacity of the farm to generate electricity. We use an example based on a two-phase Monte Carlo simulation to illustrate the use of the model.}

abstract = "Effective transmission expansion planning is necessary to ensure a power system can satisfy all demand both reliably and economically. However, at the time reinforcement decisions are made many elements of the future system background are uncertain, such as demand level, type and location of installed generators, and plant availability statistics. Making decisions which account for such uncertainties is presently usually done by considering a small set of plausible scenarios, and the resulting limited coverage of parameter space limits confidence that the resulting decision will be a good one with respect to the real world. This paper presents a methodology which uses statistical emulators to quantify uncertainty in mathematical model outputs for all points at which it has not been evaluated, and hence to control properly uncertainties in the decision process arising from the finite size set of scenarios. The result is a generally applicable approach to network planning under uncertainty, including decision makers’ risk preferences, which scales well with problem size. The approach is demonstrated on a Great Britain test problem, which replicates key features of the model the Transmission Owners use for practical strategic planning studies."

abstract = {Investments in generation are high risk, and the introduction of renewable technologies exacerbated concern over capacity adequacy in future power systems. Long-term generation investment (LTGI) models are often used by policymakers to provide future projections given different input configurations. To understand both uncertainty around these projections and the ways they relate to the real-world, LTGI models can be calibrated and then used to make predictions or perform a sensitivity analysis (SA). However, LTGI models are generally computationally intensive and so only a limited number of simulations can be carried out. This paper demonstrates that the techniques of Bayesian emulation can be applied to efficiently perform calibration, prediction and SA for such complex LTGI models.A case study relating to GB power system generation planning is presented. Calibration reduces the uncertainty over a subset of model inputs and estimates the discrepancy between the model and the real power system. A plausible range of future projections that is consistent with the available knowledge (both historical observations and expert knowledge) can be predicted. The most important uncertain inputs are identified through a comprehensive SA. The results show that the use of calibration and SA approaches enables better decision making for both investors and policymakers.},

abstract = {A model for availability growth is developed to capture the effect of systemic risk prior to construction of a complex system. The model has been motivated by new generation offshore wind farms where investment decisions need to be taken before test and operational data are available. We develop a generic model to capture the systemic risks arising from innovation in evolutionary system designs. By modelling the impact of major and minor interventions to mitigate weaknesses and to improve the failure and restoration processes of subassemblies, we are able to measure the growth in availability performance of the system. We describe the choices made in modelling our particular industrial setting using an example for a typical UK Round III offshore wind farm. We obtain point estimates of the expected availability having populated the simulated model using appropriate judgemental and empirical data. We show the relative impact of modelling systemic risk on system availability performance in comparison with estimates obtained from typical system availability modelling assumptions used in offshore wind applications. While modelling growth in availability is necessary for meaningful decision support in developing complex systems such as offshore wind farms, we also discuss the relative value of explicitly articulating epistemic uncertainties. Highlights•A new model is developed for system availability growth.•The model is motivated by and applied to the offshore wind industry.•The general model is applicable to systems where availability performance growth is important.•Systemic risks on system performance are aggregated from subassembly level modelling.•Availability-informed capability can be predicted under different intervention scenarios.},

The stochastic model is an attempt to describe the hypothesized link between deletion accumulation and neuronal loss in the substantia nigra region of the human brain. Inference for the parameters of the model is complicated by the fact that the model is both analytically intractable and slow to sample from. We show how the stochastic model can be approximated using a simple parametric statistical model with smoothly varying parameters. These parameters are treated as unknown functions and modeled using Gaussian process priors. Several simplifications of our Bayesian model are implemented to ease the computational burden. Throughout the article, we validate our models using predictive simulations. We demonstrate the validity of our fitted model on an independent dataset of substantia nigra neuron survival.},

abstract = {Policy-makers need to be confident that decisions based on the outputs of energy system models will be robust in the real-world. To make robust decisions it is critical that the consequences of uncertainty in model outputs are assessed. This paper presents statistical methodology for quantifying uncertainty associated with the output of a computer model of the long-term GB electricity supply. The output of the computer model studied is the projection of wholesale electricity prices from 2016 to 2030. The effect on wholesale prices of both uncertainty in input parameters and structural discrepancy is modelled. A probability distribution is used to model uncertainty over four inputs of the model: gas price, demand, EU ETS price and future offshore deployment. Estimates of the structural discrepancy introduced by the use of smoothed gas price projections and assuming that coal prices out to 2030 are known are obtained from experimentation with the computer model. A statistical model, known as an emulator, is fitted to a set of computer model evaluations and used to model uncertainty in the output of the computer model at inputs that have not been tested. The emulator is combined with the probability distribution over the inputs and the estimate of structural discrepancy to make an assessment of the overall uncertainty in the wholesale electricity price projections. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to investigate the effect of each of the four inputs on the trajectory of wholesale electricity prices.},

 abstract = {Many scientific phenomena are now investigated by complex computer models or codes. A computer experiment is a number of runs of the code with various inputs. A feature of many computer experiments is that the output is deterministic--rerunning the code with the same inputs gives identical observations. Often, the codes are computationally expensive to run, and a common objective of an experiment is to fit a cheaper predictor of the output to the data. Our approach is to model the deterministic output as the realization of a stochastic process, thereby providing a statistical basis for designing experiments (choosing the inputs) for efficient prediction. With this model, estimates of uncertainty of predictions are also available. Recent work in this area is reviewed, a number of applications are discussed, and we demonstrate our methodology with an example.},

abstract = {The development and use of numerical simulators to predict vessel motions is essential to design and operational decision making in offshore engineering. Increasingly, probabilistic analyses of these simulators are being used to quantify prediction uncertainty. In practice, obtaining the required number of model evaluations may be prohibited by time and computational constraints. Emulation reduces the computational burden by forming a statistical surrogate of the model. The method is Bayesian and treats the numerical simulator as an unknown function modelled by a Gaussian process prior, with covariances of the model outputs constructed as a function of the covariances of the inputs. In offshore engineering, simulator inputs include directional quantities and we describe a way to build this information into the covariance structure. The methodology is discussed with reference to a numerical simulator which computes the mean turret offset amplitude of a FPSO in response to environmental forcing. It is demonstrated through statistical diagnostics that the emulator is well designed, with evaluations executed around 60,000 times faster than the numeric simulator. The method is generalisable to many offshore engineering numerical simulators that require directional inputs and is widely applicable to industry. •Emulation is used to reduce the computational expense of a numerical simulator.•Methodology is developed to allow for the emulation of directional inputs.•The emulator is validated using a suite of statistical validation diagnostics.•Mean offset amplitude is emulated for a FPSO moored in the Australian NW shelf.},

The explanation is that computer experiments are, by definition, “deterministic”, and so there is no measurement error. We think this is too narrow a focus for a computer experiment and a statistically inefficient way to model them. We show that estimating a (non-zero) nugget can lead to surrogate models with better statistical properties, such as predictive accuracy and coverage, in a variety of common situations.},

Simulators are often so complex that they take appreciable amounts of computer time or other resources to run. In this context, a methodology has been developed based on building a statistical representation of the simulator, known as an emulator. The principal approach to building emulators uses Gaussian processes. This work presents some diagnostics to validate and assess the adequacy of a Gaussian process emulator as surrogate for the simulator. These diagnostics are based on comparisons between simulator outputs and Gaussian process emulator outputs for some test data, known as validation data, defined by a sample of simulator runs not used to build the emulator. Our diagnostics take care to account for correlation between the validation data. To illustrate a validation procedure, we apply these diagnostics to two different data sets.},

abstract = {Optimization of complex functions, such as the output of computer simulators, is a difficult task that has received much attention in the literature. A less studied problem is that of optimization under unknown constraints, i.e., when the simulator must be invoked both to determine the typical real‐valued response and to determine if a constraint has been violated, either for physical or policy reasons. We develop a statistical approach based on Gaussian processes and Bayesian learning to both approximate the unknown function and estimate the probability of meeting the constraints. A new integrated improvement criterion is proposed to recognize that responses from inputs that violate the constraint may still be informative about the function, and thus could potentially be useful in the optimization. The new criterion is illustrated on synthetic data, and on a motivating optimization problem from health care policy.},

abstract = {Individual-based (IB) modelling has been widely used for studying the emergence of complex interactions of bacterial biofilms and their environment. We describe the emulation and calibration of an expensive dynamic simulator of an IB model of microbial communities. We used a combination of multivariate dynamic linear models (DLM) and a Gaussian process to estimate the model parameters of our dynamic emulators. The emulators incorporate a smoothly varying and nonstationary trend that is modelled as a deterministic function of explanatory variables while the Gaussian process (GP) is allowed to capture the remaining intrinsic local variations. We applied this emulation strategy for parameter calibration of a newly developed model for simulation of microbial communities against the iDynoMiCS model. The percentage of variance explained for the four outputs biomass concentration, the total number of particles, biofilm average height and surface roughness range between 84—92% and 97–99% for univariate and multivariate emulators respectively. The simulation-based sensitivity analysis identified carbon substrate, oxygen concentration and maximum specific growth rate for heterotrophic bacteria as the most critical variables for predictions. The calibration results also indicated a general reduction of uncertainty levels in most of the parameters. The study has helped us identify the tradeoff in using different types of models for microbial simulation. The approach illustrated here provides a tractable and computationally efficient technique for calibrating the parameters of an expensive computer model.},

abstract = {Abstract Determining and understanding offshore wind turbine failure rates and resource requirement for repair are vital for modelling and reducing O\&M costs and in turn reducing the cost of energy. While few offshore failure rates have been published in the past even less details on resource requirement for repair exist in the public domain. Based on ~350 offshore wind turbines throughout Europe this paper provides failure rates for the overall wind turbine and its sub-assemblies. It also provides failure rates by year of operation, cost category and failure modes for the components/sub-assemblies that are the highest contributor to the overall failure rate. Repair times, average repair costs and average number of technicians required for repair are also detailed in this paper. An onshore to offshore failure rate comparison is carried out for generators and converters based on this analysis and an analysis carried out in a past publication. The results of this paper will contribute to offshore wind O\&M cost and resource modelling and aid in better decision making for O\&M planners and managers.

We model the arrival time of farming at radiocarbon-dated, early Neolithic sites by a numerical solution to an advancing wavefront. We allow for (technical) uncertainty in the radiocarbon data, lack-of-fit of the deterministic model and use a Gaussian process to smooth spatial deviations from the model. Inference for the parameters in the wavefront model is complicated by the computational cost required to produce a single numerical solution. We therefore employ Gaussian process emulators for the arrival time of the advancing wavefront at each radiocarbon-dated site. We validate our model using predictive simulations.},

    abstract = {Bayesian optimization is a sample-efficient approach to global optimization that relies on theoretically motivated value heuristics (acquisition functions) to guide its search process. Fully maximizing acquisition functions produces the Bayes' decision rule, but this ideal is difficult to achieve since these functions are frequently non-trivial to optimize. This statement is especially true when evaluating queries in parallel, where acquisition functions are routinely non-convex, high-dimensional, and intractable. We first show that acquisition functions estimated via Monte Carlo integration are consistently amenable to gradient-based optimization. Subsequently, we identify a common family of acquisition functions, including EI and UCB, whose properties not only facilitate but justify use of greedy approaches for their maximization.},

abstract = {The effect of a Gaussian process parameter known as the nugget, on the development of computer model emulators is investigated. The presence of the nugget results in an emulator that does not interpolate the data and attaches a non-zero uncertainty bound around them. The limits of this approximation are investigated theoretically, and it is shown that they can be as large as those of a least squares model with the same regression functions as the emulator, regardless of the nugget’s value. The likelihood of the correlation function parameters is also studied and two mode types are identified. Type I modes are characterised by an approximation error that is a function of the nugget and can therefore become arbitrarily small, effectively yielding an interpolating emulator. Type II modes result in emulators with a constant approximation error. Apart from a theoretical investigation of the limits of the approximation error, a practical method for automatically imposing restrictions on its extent is introduced. This is achieved by means of a penalty term that is added to the likelihood function, and controls the amount of unexplainable variability in the computer model. The main findings are illustrated on data from an Energy Balance climate model.},

Moreover, it allows inferential statements to be made about predictive error associated with model predictions in untested situations. The framework is implemented in a test bed example of resistance spot welding, to provide context for each of the six steps in the proposed validation process.},

@article{Wang02,

abstract = {In this paper, a general form of bathtub shape hazard rate function is proposed in terms of reliability. The degradation of system reliability comes from different failure mechanisms, in particular those related to (1) random failures, (2) cumulative damage, (3) man–machine interference, and (4) adaptation. The first item is referred to the modeling of unpredictable failures in a Poisson process, i.e. it is shown by a constant. Cumulative damage emphasizes the failures owing to strength deterioration and therefore the possibility of system sustaining the normal operation load decreases with time. It depends on the failure probability, 1− R . This representation denotes the memory characteristics of the second failure cause. Man–machine interference may lead to a positive effect in the failure rate due to learning and correction, or negative from the consequence of human inappropriate habit in system operations, etc. It is suggested that this item is correlated to the reliability, R , as well as the failure probability. Adaptation concerns with continuous adjusting between the mating subsystems. When a new system is set on duty, some hidden defects are explored and disappeared eventually. Therefore, the reliability decays combined with decreasing failure rate, which is expressed as a power of reliability. Each of these phenomena brings about the failures independently and is described by an additive term in the hazard rate function h ( R ), thus the overall failure behavior governed by a number of parameters is found by fitting the evidence data. The proposed model is meaningful in capturing the physical phenomena occurring during the system lifetime and provides for simpler and more effective parameter fitting than the usually adopted ‘bathtub’ procedures. Five examples of different type of failure mechanisms are taken in the validation of the proposed model. Satisfactory results are found from the comparisons.},

abstract = {This thesis reports on investigations undertaken into the reliability, availability and maintenance of offshore wind farms when considering different maintenance strategies, an understanding of which is fundamental when considering the technical and economical viability of existing and future offshore wind farms. A comprehensive literature review has been undertaken in the areas of offshore wind farm maintenance strategies, offshore wind turbine reliability and accessibility issues, and CO2 emissions associated with maintenance expeditions for offshore wind farms. The limitations and disadvantages of current maintenance practices are identified and a planned intervention maintenance policy is proposed and examined in detail. To help design a planned intervention maintenance policy, the offshore wind farm parameters that affect its technical and economical viability have been identified, which become the foundation for developing computer based models using Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the maintenance practices of the planned intervention maintenance policy. Different scenarios of the proposed solution are investigated to help quantify the technical and economical benefits over the current maintenance practises, in terms of wind farm availability, cumulative energy output, production cost of energy and CO2 emissions. The research on the reliability of offshore wind turbines has shown that the power converter system is a critical item that suffers from high failure rates. This thesis reports upon the investigation of a hot standby redundancy on the wind turbine power converter system. A redundancy model is deployed to simulate the planned intervention maintenance policy for different offshore wind farm case studies in order to establish the effects of the hot standby redundancy on the offshore wind turbine operational performance. The novel contribution of this work is claimed to be in the development of dedicated models for the reliability, availability and maintenance of offshore wind farms, which should lead in establishing a technical and economic benchmark for the parameters affecting offshore wind farms.},
