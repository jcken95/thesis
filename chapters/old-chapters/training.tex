\section{Articles}

At current, I have one submission \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08921}{``Multilevel Emulation for Stochastic Computer Models with An Application to Large Offshore Windfarms''}. This work is currently under review by the Annals of Applied Statistics.

\section{Training}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Academy for PhD Training in Statistics
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Statistical Computing and Statistical Inference, Cambridge, December 2018
			\item High-Dimensional Statistics and Computer Intensive Statistics, Durham, July 2019
		\end{itemize}
		\item SAGE Faculty Workshops
		Various dates and events. See attached document (\Cref{Fig:workshops}).
	\end{itemize}


At current, there are no plans to attend any conferences/training events. In part this is due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
