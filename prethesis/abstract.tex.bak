Computationally expensive computer models, known as simulators, are fundamental to the modern scientific process. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in \emph{stochastic simualators} as analysts aim to model uncertainty about predictions. Stochastic simulators are now found in all areas of science, we focus on a particular simulator known as the Athena simulator which is used to assess the performance of offshore wind farms in their early life.

Athena is typical of many stochastic simulators in that it can take a long time to run on a computer and the variance exhibited by the simulator changes with the inputs. This poses multiple computational challenges for subjective Bayesians who wish to perform computer-intensive tasks such as uncertainty analysis, sensitivity analysis or decision support. A common solution to the large computation cost of such analyses is to construct a fast statistical surrogate model, known as an \emph{emulator}, to produce an efficient approximation to the simulator with an appropriate quantification of uncertainty attached to the prediction. Two popular emulators for stochastic simulators the HomGP, the homoscedastic Gaussian process, the other type is HetGP, the heteroscedastic Gaussian process.

The first contribution of this thesis the proposition of a method based upon \citet{Kennedy2000} which seeks to exploit fast approximations of the Athena model to constuct an improved emulator. The approach considers an autogressive structure for different `levels' of a simulator. The second contribution of this thesis is improving the tractability and interpretability of HetGP. Many Bayesian emulators require computationally intensive methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo to quantify uncertainty about emulator parameters. We propose using a conjugate prior for HetGP which provides further computational savings and allows for tractable uncertainty quantification about many emulator parameters. Our Bayesian HetGPs are used to perform a sensitivity analysis as preperation for expert elicitation about parameters of the Athena simulator. The final contribution of this thesis is marrying together two competing philosophies. We show that, via Bayesian Optimisation and History Matching, that decision making and decision support are complementary technolgies and apply this novel approach to construct a set of feasible solutions to a resource allocation problem within an offshore wind farm.
