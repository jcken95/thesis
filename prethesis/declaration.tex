\section*{Declaration}
I declare this thesis is my own reasearch and unless explicity stated, the writing, research and code used to implement methods is my own.

The Athena model was developed at the University of Strathclyde, apart from the modifications required to implement a spare parts strategy in section 2.1.1, which are my own.

Parts of Chapters 4 and 5 have been published in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series C (Applied Statistics) \citet{Kennedy2023}. This paper was co-authored by my supervisors, Kevin Wilson and Daniel Henderson, however the research and novel ideas are my own.

This thesis has not been submitted for examination at another university.
