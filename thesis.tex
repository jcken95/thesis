%-----------
% This is a template which hopefully is useful to anyone putting together their
% thesis.  It is usually a good idea to have one main file (such as this) which
% includes all your chapters.  That way you can work on separate chapters
% without having to compile your whole thesis.  I would also recommend not
% calling your files chap1.tex, chap2.tex etc., since you are bound to want to
% change the order around, and then the numberings will just cause confusion!

% Set the class and font size.  The article class does not allow chapters, so
% you'll want to avoid that.  I used 11pt for final submission.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Set the left and right margins.  Remember, you will need to leave more space
% on the left, to allow for binding, when it comes to submission.  You can
% easily change the margins as you like, but I think there must be at least a
% 30mm margin on the binding edge.
